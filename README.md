Adyen Integration - Sample
===

This provides a sample on how to integrate the Adyen SDK into a code base. The integration consists of three separate
components:

1. [FakeMcDuckStuff](FakeMcDuckStuff.kt): Retrofit service for the server integration
2. [MakePayment](MakePayment.kt): Integration of Adyen SDK logic with the server integration
3. [MainActivity](MainActivity.kt): Activity that contains view logic for integration
